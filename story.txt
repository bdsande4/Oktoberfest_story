One day I was walking down Hauptstrasse when a Bratwurst fell fell onto my head from a window aboove.

 A hund jumped from a schloss after the Bratwurst, tripping me, and disappeared into the distance.

I was just trying to see Rammstein play in the Beirgarten, I didn't think I was going to be assaulted by Bratwurst.
